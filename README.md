Subspace is a FRAME-based [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) blockchain node
that provides the foundation for [Commune's](https://www.communeai.org/)
network. It serves as the trusted base layer responsible for consensus, module
advertising, and peer discovery.

## Overview

Subspace is built using [Substrate](https://substrate.io/), a framework for
developing scalable and upgradeable blockchains. It provides the core
functionality and security needed for Commune's platform:

1. Implements Commune's consensus mechanism
2. Advertises cluster modules and their IP addresses
3. Enables peer discovery for nodes to connect with each other

## System Requirements

- Supported OSs: Linux, MacOS
- Supported Architectures: x86_64
- Memory: ~ 286MB
- Disk: ~500MB
- Network: Public IPv4 address, TCP ports 9944, 30333 open

## Installation

1. Complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./docs/rust-setup.md).

2. Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/commune-network/subspace.git
cd subspace/
```

## Usage

### Build

To build the node without launching it, run:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Run

To run a single development node with ephemeral storage:

```sh
./target/release/node-subspace --dev
```

This will start a Subspace node with a clean state. The node's state will be
discarded on exit.

To retain the node's state between runs, specify a base path:

```sh
mkdir my-chain-state/
./target/release/node-subspace --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/  
```

Other useful commands:

```sh
# Purge chain state
./target/release/node-subspace purge-chain --dev

# Detailed logging
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/subspace-ldebug --dev

# Explore parameters and subcommands 
./target/release/node-subspace -h
```

### Test

To run all tests:

```sh
cargo test --all
```

To run specific tests:

```sh
cargo test -p pallet-subspace --test test_voting
```

To run tests with detailed logs:

```sh
SKIP_WASM_BUILD=1 RUST_LOG=runtime=debug cargo test -- --nocapture  
```

## Architecture

Subspace leverages the modular and extensible architecture of Substrate. It uses
FRAME pallets to encapsulate domain-specific logic such as consensus, storage,
and p2p networking.

Notable components:

- `/node`: Implementation of the Subspace node including networking, consensus, and RPC
- `/runtime`: The core blockchain logic responsible for validating and executing state transitions
- `/pallets`: Custom FRAME pallets with Commune-specific logic
